# cse237-project: Iteration 3
* What user stories were completed this iteration?
    * As a potential user, I am able to create my own recipe
    * As a potential user, I am able to see which ingredients I have for the listed recipes
    * As a potential user, I am able to view saved recipes from the UI
    * Our group mainly focused on fixing the code from Iteration 2 and implementing comments from peer review

* Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
    * Currently our testing for the recipeBook has been having compiling errors, which was caused when multiple people tried working on eclipse at the same time. 
    
   * Final Reflections from Iteration #3
   - We were very ambitious during our pitch and didn't anticipate some issues that arose and thought about our timeline formt he project
   - If we were able to do it again, we would have met more regular to discuss specific dates and debug together on a Zoom. 
   - Overall, we've learned a lot about project management and code cleanliness.

* What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
    * ./run.sh
