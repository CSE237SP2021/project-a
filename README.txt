# cse237-project
* What user stories were completed this iteration?
    * As a potential user, I want to be able to add/remove/check inventory
    * As a potential user, I am able to navigate the UI easily to the different sections and return to the main menu easily
    * As a potential user, I am able to add create new recipes
    * Our group mainly focused on fixing the code from Iteration 1 and implementing comments from peer review

* What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
    * Next iteration, we want the user to be able to add new recipes 
    * A user should be able to check available recipes
    * A user should be able to sort the recipes by ingredients in the fridge

* Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
    * The the recipe section of the UI is still under development. Right now, the user can access these tabs, but the recipe objects have not yet been created. We have created the recipe tests first (based on feedback from Iteration #1)

* What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
    * ./run.sh
