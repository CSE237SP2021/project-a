* What user stories were completed this iteration?
    * As a potential user, I want to be able to decide which feature/initiate Inventory Management or Recipe Suggester of my refrigerator so I can decide what I want to make
    * As a potential user, I want to be able to add inventory into my fridge so I can keep an accurate inventory 
    * As a potential user, I want to be able to remove inventory into my fridge so I can keep an accurate inventory
    * As a potential user, I want to be able to get a list of all the items in my refrigerator so I can see what ingredients I have.
* Essentially, our group wanted to create a framework of basic functions so that the user could do very basic things

* What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
    * As a potential user, I want to be able to access quantity of items that I have for each of my refrigerator so I can see if I have enough materials for a food 
    * As a potential user, I want to be able to be suggested at least one recipe from the items that I have in my refrigerator
* Essentially, by the next iteration we want to be able to fine-tune the details of the basic functions and start working on the more complex ones such as suggesting

* Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
    * Currently our add and remove + quantity tracker  seem to be working along with the UI
    * However, the UI still needs some work because we never thought about how the user would get out of our covid and navigate through our code between recipes and inventory management
    * 
* What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
    * CD to where user interface project-a
    * Java c  User_Interface.java
    * Java User_interface.java
    * When using user interface, type entire menu name instead of the number (ie "Inventory Management")
    * We are currently in the process of making this easier for the user to access rather than using multiple commands of Java.
