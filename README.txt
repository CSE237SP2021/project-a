# cse237-project: Iteration 3
* What user stories were completed this iteration?
    * As a potential user, I am able to create my own recipe
    * As a potential user, I am able to see which ingredients I have for the listed recipes
    * As a potential user, I am able to view saved recipes from the UI
    * Our group mainly focused on fixing the code from Iteration 2, implementing comments from peer review, and trying to implement the functionality to suggest recipes based on inventory

* Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
    * Currently, the functionality to suggest recipes is not working properly. The idea was to allow the user to be able tto recieve a list of suggested recipes based on the contents of their inventory, but there is a bug with this method that we couldn't quite figure out. So, in our RecipeBook Testing, the code is not passing the suggestRecipes test. The ability to suggest recipes was, admittedly, a little ambitious but we believe that we are actually close to being able to fully implement this functionality (we just ran out of time). 
    
   * Final Reflections from Iteration #3
   - We were very ambitious during our pitch and didn't anticipate some issues that arose and thought about our timeline from the project
   - If we were able to do it again, we would have met more regularly to discuss specific dates and debug together on a Zoom. Working with others in a remote setting requires very careful and consistent communication, and we improved with each iteration but would definitely make more adjustments. 
   - It was extremely important for us to take in the feedback for each of the iterations as we saw drastic improvements from the first iteration to the third. Even now, there's still feedback that we could use to continue improving our project, despite it being the final iteration. 
   - Overall, we've learned a lot about project management and code cleanliness. Moreover, one of the most important things we have learned is how to efficiently navigate working on a computer science project with other collaborators in a way that is efficient and effective.

* What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
    * ./run.sh
